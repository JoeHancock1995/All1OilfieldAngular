          <p>
            Alliance One Oilfield provides inventory assessment survey. This can be performed on either capital equipment or spare
            inventory. We will perform a survey, whether on the rig or within a shore based warehouse to determine condition of
            equipment. Typically this service is performed on equipment that has been stacked and prior to being re-activated
            allowing the customer to know exact condition prior to the re-activation. Spare inventory assessment also looks at
            condition of spares and determines whether spares need to be replaced etc.
